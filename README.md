Credit Risk Predictor (Finance DS Portfolio Project)

A clean, production-style demo of a credit risk scoring workflow using unsupervised anomaly detection.

Data → EDA → Preprocessing → Training → Evaluation → Streamlit App

Built with scikit-learn, deployed locally via Streamlit.

Features

Isolation Forest–based anomaly detection for unlabeled credit data

End-to-end modular ML pipeline (train, evaluate, serve)

Encodes categorical data + scales numeric fields automatically

Generates saved model artifacts (.joblib) + metrics JSON

Streamlit UI for interactive single-applicant scoring

Clean folder structure following DS best practices

Dataset

German Credit Data (UCI Statlog Project) — 1,000 anonymized credit applications from a German bank (1980s).
Each record includes demographic + financial info such as:

Feature	Description
Age	Applicant’s age (years)
Sex	Male / Female
Job	Employment level (0–3)
Housing	rent / own / free
Saving accounts	little / moderate / rich
Checking account	level of funds
Credit amount	Loan size requested
Duration	Repayment period (months)
Purpose	Reason for the loan

Source: UCI ML Repository — German Credit Data

(This version omits the original Risk label — the model learns patterns without supervision.)

Model Overview

Algorithm: IsolationForest
Goal: Detect unusual credit applicants (“high-risk anomalies”)
Logic: Outliers are isolated faster → flagged as riskier
Output:

Anomaly score (higher = safer)

Prediction: “Low Risk” or “High Risk”

Setup
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/credit-risk-predictor.git
cd credit-risk-predictor

# Create virtual env
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate

# Install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

Train & Evaluate
# Train Isolation Forest model
python -m src.train_unsupervised

# Evaluate & save metrics
python -m src.evaluate_unsupervised


Output:

Trained unsupervised model → models/credit_model.joblib
Saved metrics to models/metrics.json

Run the App
python -m streamlit run src/app_unsupervised.py


Then open http://localhost:8501
